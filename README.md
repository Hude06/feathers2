This is a project to explore using the Feather S2 with Circuit Python. 
There are code samples for the

* build in LED
* built in RGB LED

* external (STEMMA) pressure, humidity, temp sensor
#Wether staion server

So the server uses the weather sensor and it connects to the wifi and sends it to a web site witch then i puts it into a graph
When you downlode the code you need to uplode it to your feather S2 and you need to change the code for your correct wifi info
